# Washington State Housing Data Analysis Using Support Vector Models  

This project explores housing patterns in Washington State using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify occupancy status as "owned" or "rented." Leveraging data from the US Census (via IPUMS USA), the study analyzes the impact of demographic and housing-related factors such as age, income, marital status, and household attributes. Three types of SVM kernels—linear, radial, and polynomial—were applied to build predictive models, with performance evaluated on accuracy and decision boundary visualization. Extensive data preprocessing, encoding of categorical variables, and feature scaling ensured high-quality analysis. Insights derived from this study can guide housing policy decisions, urban planning strategies, and resource allocation by identifying key predictors of homeownership. The project employs robust SVM modeling techniques to optimize predictive performance and uncover meaningful patterns in housing data.
